# Instructions for using Github Codespaces

## Prerequisites:

- Github account (Both for you and the Candidate).
    - While not required it would be best for this to be a personal account
- Access to the repository with all the projects setup
  (https://github.com/LGNDLeviathan/DCCoding)
- LiveShare plugin

- You can create a codespace from the repository or use the existing one. To
  create a new one, click on the code button and create codespace on main. Once
  this has been joined you should setup any necessary plugins such as LiveShare
  and any java or syntax highlighting plugins as suggested by Visual Studio.

## Compilation and Running for the first time:

When running the projects for the first time ensure the tests can be run

### Java

run `./gradlew test`

If you get the error `bash: ./gradlew: Permission denied` then run the following command `chmod +x ./gradlew`. This will give gradlew execution
permissions and allow it to be run. After running it the tests should run but fail.

### Python

run `python3 test_main.py`

### Javascript

To check npm is working, type `npm -v` into the Visual Studio Code terminal (note - `npm` commands will only work in the
Node.js or Visual Studio Code terminal)

Run the following commands:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm test` or `npm t` to run all tests.

### C Sharp

1. Download the .NET Core 3.0 SDK:
`wget https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/7b1e6b8c-8f8e-4b1e-8b1e-8b1e8b1e8b1e/dotnet-sdk-3.0.100-linux-x64.tar.gz -O dotnet-sdk-3.0.100-linux-x64.tar.gz`
2. Extract the SDK: 
`mkdir -p $HOME/dotnet && tar zxf dotnet-sdk-3.0.100-linux-x64.tar.gz -C $HOME/dotnet`
3. Then set up environment variables:
   - `export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/dotnet`
   - `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/dotnet`

You can verify the installation was successful with the following command:
`dotnet --version`

After doing this you can compile and run the project using the following two commands

1. `dotnet build`
2. `dotnet test`

If you need any further guidance each project has a readme with further information on
how to run each project.

## Setting up and running Liveshare:

Make sure that the live share plugin is installed in your Codespace. Click the Live Share button at the bottom of the screen and share the link to join with the Candidate. 
They  will need to sign in to their personal github account to be able to edit. Guests only have read-only access. 
Once they have joined you will see a cursor with their position in the  code. 

You both can now edit the code freely and run commands as necessary.
